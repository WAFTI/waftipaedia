Bananarama were a British group of girls, active in the 1980s and presumably also in their lives leading up to that time.

They took their name from the 1970s protest campaign _Ban Ana Rama_ -- a movement to silence the controversial far-right fruit critic [[Ana Rama]] who wrote for the Telegraph at the time.
