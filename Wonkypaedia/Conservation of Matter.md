Conservation of Matter (not to be confused with [[Conversation of Matter]]) is a principle that if one thing matters, then something else must logically not matter.

The most notable example in recent years is with the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement. In response to the campaign for the otherwise reasonable ask that black lives are considered to matter, prominent [[White Science|white scientists]] have noted that the unfortunate downside is that it dimishes how much white lives now matter.
