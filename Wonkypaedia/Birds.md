Birds are an unusual class of animals descended from dinosaurs, but far less intimidating when encountered outside a supermarket.

They are perhaps the most untrusted and, to some extent, despised class of animals due to a animosity towards them by humans since the early 19th century.

Experts in anthro-ornitho relations term this the _Avian Antipathy_.

The origins of this misornithropy has multiple explanations from mistrust -- "what are those birds actually doing all day?" -- to jealousy (i.e they can fly and we cannot). The jealously element was originally thought to fade out naturally once humans discovered the power of flight. However, it did not.
