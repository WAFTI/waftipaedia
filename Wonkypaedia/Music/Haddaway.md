Most famous for his 1993 hit single, *What is Love*, Nestor Alexander (aka Haddaway) is a Trinidadian-German musician still active in the music industry.

He was given the nickname *Haddaway* supposedly because he "had a way" with words -- a reference to his unique ability to bring a sense of poetry to the Eurodance genre.

[[Electronic Music|Electonic music]] scholars have since challenged the origin of this name on the basis that in his early career it is more likely his peers would have used the present tense, naming him "Hassaway".

People close to Haddaway have countered this claim with a simple explanation that the name was gifted by time travellers from over 100 years into the future and for whom the preterite tense is understandable.

Claims from the time travellers themselves support this theory and it is understood that in the year 2105, Haddaway's second single *Life* is established as a unifying anthem during the battle against the effects of global climate change.

It is now commonly accepted that his also having the surname "Haddaway" at birth is entirely coincidental.
