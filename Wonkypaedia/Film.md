A film is defined as audio-visual piece of art or entertainment with a duration long enough you'll want to pause for at least one toilet break.

The word derives originally from the acronym FILM which stands for _Fast Image and Light Malarky_, a reference to the video effect being a form of optical illusion with a bright light shining through a rapid succesion of images imprinted on film.
