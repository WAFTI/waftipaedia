The **Boston T Party** was an American and lexicographic protest by the Sons of Glottal Stop in [[Boston]] on December 16, 1773.

They threw all available forms of the letter 'T' into the Boston Harbour so that Americans would be free from the need to pronounce it in many words in American English.

The words liberated that day include batter, bitter, butter, caterpillar, city, hotter, latter, letter, matter, meeting, meter, relative, sitter, sweater, water, whatever.
