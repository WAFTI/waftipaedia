    <h1>Birds</h1>
    

    <p>Birds are an unusual class of animals descended from dinosaurs, but far less intimidating when encountered outside a&nbsp;supermarket.</p>
<p>They are perhaps the most untrusted and, to some extent, despised class of animals due to a animosity towards them by humans since the early 19th&nbsp;century.</p>
<p>Experts in anthro-ornitho relations term this the <em>Avian Antipathy</em>.</p>
<p>The origins of this misornithropy has multiple explanations from mistrust &#8212; &#8220;what are those birds actually doing all day?&#8221; &#8212; to jealousy (i.e they can fly and we cannot). The jealously element was originally thought to fade out naturally once humans discovered the power of flight. However, it did&nbsp;not.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>The word &#8220;bird&#8221; comes from an ancient Greek term &#8220;birythmos&#8221; which means &#8220;flighty&#8221; or &#8220;unpredictable&#8221;. This term was used to describe the quick, unpredictable movements of birds in the air. As time went on, the term was shortened to &#8220;bir&#8221; and eventually evolved into the English word &#8220;bird&#8221;. This etymology suggests that the word &#8220;bird&#8221; has its origins in ancient Greek, and implies that birds have always been associated with flightiness and&nbsp;unpredictability.</p>
